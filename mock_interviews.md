### Freshmen/Sophomore Internships

There are many internships specifically for freshmen and sophomores, which you should apply to even if you don't have much programming experience.

## Interview Prep

### What are some good resources to help you prepare for technical interviews?

- [CodingBat Practice Problems](https://codingbat.com/python){:target="_blank"} has good warmup problems to practice with
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/){:target="_blank"} is a solid book to learn or review core CS concepts and how to use them in interviews. For freshmen, this book may be a bit too advanced.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/){:target="_blank"} and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/){:target="_blank"} have tons of practice questions with automatic testing


## Mock Interviews 

We have Google Engineers that will provide free mock interviews to you.

### What will the mock interviews be like?

The goal of the interviews is to simulate what real technical interviews may be like with various companies, so you can better understand what to expect. The goal of these interviews specifically is *not* to teach you brand new content (e.g. a question requires a data structure but you’ve never heard of it before), so please tell your mock interviewer if they are asking you something you haven’t learned yet.

Your interviewer will come prepared with a question (or maybe a few, depending on question difficulty). Don’t be afraid to ask clarifying questions - the interview should feel more like a conversation and less like an interrogation. If something is confusing, talk through it with your interviewer and they can help push you in the right direction.

Afterwards, your interviewer will provide you with feedback as well as tips on how to improve your interviewing skills. 


### Mock Interviews with CS 104 Google TAs

Use the button below to sign up for a mock interview slot with one of the Google TAs. Click on one of the empty appointment slots and click save to book it. Consider spending time working on practice problems between each interview and sign up for only 1 per week to allow multiple students to sign up.

Please sign up a few hours in advance to give the Google TA notice (e.g. do not sign up for an appointment 15 minutes before it is scheduled). If these timings do not work but you'd still like to attend a mock interview, reach out to Sonam to find more times. 

Use a gmail account so that a Google Meet link will be added to your Google Calendar.
