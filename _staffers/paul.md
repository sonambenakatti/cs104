My name is Paul and I am based in the Boulder, CO office. I work on the ChromeOS team, helping speedy, simple, and secure computing devices to students, home users, and business users. I'm currently working on the ChromeOS Hardware Tools Team building devices that we use to automate testing in the lab.
