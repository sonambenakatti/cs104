Hello! My name is Lyric Sampson, an honors, sophomore, computer science major from Maryland. Just a little bit about me; I enjoy playing sports, hanging out with my friends and going bowling. (If you ever want to go, Iâ€™m always down!) I also LOVE sour patch kids and listening to R&B. This will be my 2nd semester as a TA for this course and I look forward to meeting you.
