I work on Chrome OS software performance, and have been with Google for 12 years. I was born and raised in Bahrain but am ethnically South Asian. I came to California to go to grad school and have been here ever since. For fun, I enjoy travel, Latin partner dance, scuba, plant-based food, and fitness.
