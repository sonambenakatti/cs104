I am Da'Quandalon Daniel, a sophomore computer science major from Gadsden, AL, with a 4.0 GPA at Alabama A&M University. I recently completed an internship program this past summer through the National Defense Education Program (Sponsored by the United States Department of Defense). I enjoy learning and experiencing new things. I love to fish, try new restaurants, and I'm an absolute sneakerhead I love to buy shoes. I'm very friendly and enjoy meeting new people, so don't be scared to reach out. I look forward to assisting with this course.
