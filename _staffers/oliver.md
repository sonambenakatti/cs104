Hi! My name is Oli and I work on the rebilling team for Google Cloud, helping users configure complicated billing mechanics at high scale. I'm Australian and went to school back home where I TA'd courses including Algos, Compression and Neural Networks before coming to the USA several years ago. For fun I love oil painting, pottery, cycling and football.
