Bonjour mes amis.  I am Ms. Terry Miller, a native of Huntsville, AL and a twice alum from Alabama A&M University in Computer Science.  I have worked at the university since 2003 in various offices and enjoy working with students.  I love action packed-thriller type movies with espionage, intelligence and trade secrets.  In my spare time, I cook gourmet dishes and travel with friends and family.   One of the things on my bucket list it to travel to all 7 continents in the world.  I have a 28 year old son and a 2 year old granddaughter, who is the boss of our family.
